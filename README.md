## vit-for-retrofitting

taking base vit and trying to apply latest ml techniques 

base code from https://youtu.be/j3VNqtJUoz0?si=6qtyM-YlYdjckjZw (deepfindr)
who i think used code based on the original paper (https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.11929) but i wasnt able to find it after several seconds of extremely thorough searching
its the same pattern as pretty much every other pytorch based model ive seen though
